## Prompt

Read @specs\ and @Requirments.md by using explore agent and then make Constitution.md

## Response snapshot

Created the initial Hackathon III: Reusable Intelligence Constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with:

**10 Core Principles:**
1. Skills-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE) - Skills are the primary product
2. MCP Code Execution Pattern (NON-NEGOTIABLE) - >80% token savings
3. Test-First with Independent User Stories - TDD mandatory
4. Spec-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE) - Spec-Kit Plus framework
5. Microservices with Event-Driven Architecture - Kafka + Dapr
6. Progressive Disclosure - Documentation hierarchy
7. Kubernetes-Native Deployment - Proper manifests
8. Observability and Logging - Structured logging
9. Security and Secrets Management - No hardcoded secrets
10. Simplicity and YAGNI - Avoid over-engineering

**Additional Sections:**
- Quality Standards (Token Efficiency, Performance, Testing)
- Technology Stack (Required technologies, Language versions)
- Development Workflow (Feature flow, Skill flow)
- Governance (Amendment procedure, Versioning, Compliance)

**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Ratified:** 2025-01-26

## Outcome

- Impact: Establishes foundational governance for Hackathon III project
- Tests: N/A (governance document)
- Files: Created .specify/memory/constitution.md with 10 principles aligned to evaluation criteria
- Next prompts: Continue with skill implementation based on constitution principles
- Reflection: Constitution directly maps to hackathon evaluation criteria (Skills Autonomy 15%, Token Efficiency 10%, Cross-Agent 5%, Architecture 20%, MCP Integration 10%, Documentation 10%, Spec-Kit Plus 15%, LearnFlow 15%)

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - initial constitution creation
- Graders run and results: N/A
- Prompt variant: N/A
- Next experiment: Apply constitution principles to agents-md-gen skill implementation
